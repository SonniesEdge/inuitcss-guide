### Extracted notes
<https://github.com/inuitcss/base.page/blob/master/_base.page.scss>
```
* High-, page-level styling.
*
* 1. Set the default `font-size` and `line-height` for the entire project,
*    sourced from our default variables. The `font-size` is calculated to exist
*    in ems, the `line-height` is calculated to exist unitlessly.
* 2. Force scrollbars to always be visible to prevent awkward ‘jumps’ when
*    navigating between pages that do/do not have enough content to produce
*    scrollbars naturally.
* 3. Ensure the page always fills at least the entire height of the viewport.
* 4. Prevent certain mobile browsers from automatically zooming fonts.
* 5. Fonts on OSX will look more consistent with other systems that do not
*    render text using sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
